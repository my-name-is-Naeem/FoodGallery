            <h1>White Rice Puttu</h1>
            <p>Puttu served with kadala kari is one of the most popular breakfast combinations from Kerala. Puttu is basically a steamed rice flour and coconut log. The combination of soft rice puttu with Kadala Kari (black chickpeas curry) is awesome and you should taste it to know what I mean. Traditionally puttu was made in bamboo logs and this gave the puttu a lovely aroma.</p>

            <h1>String-Hoppers-with-Egg-Curry</h1>
            <p>Idiyappam/Noolappam/Rice string Hoppers is one of the breakfast recipes which amma used to make during the weekend. It requires elaborate process of soaking the rice, and then pounding it in a powder, making dough and pressing the dough through the mould and finally cooking it in a steamer. She would make potato stew or ishtu to go with it. If you ask me I am lazy when it comes to make some dishes, while for some other dishes I will go all the way create them.</p>
