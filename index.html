            <p>Idiyappam/Noolappam/Rice string Hoppers is one of the breakfast recipes which amma used to make during the weekend. It requires elaborate process of soaking the rice, and then pounding it in a powder, making dough and pressing the dough through the mould and finally cooking it in a steamer. She would make potato stew or ishtu to go with it. If you ask me I am lazy when it comes to make some dishes, while for some other dishes I will go all the way create them.</p>

            <h1>Chicken Tikka Masala
</h1>
            <p>This Indian chicken tikka masala is officially in my top 5 favorites by Thomas! The sauce is insane, the chicken is soft, and there is just so much flavor! It seems complicated because there are so many spices/ ingredients, but I realize that's why Indian food is so good. One of my favorite takeout choices! They just really know how to flavor their food.</p>
